Regression - y = f(x). functional relationship between input and output.
y = target,
y = B + B1x1 + B2x2+ .......BnXn. Linear Regression
y = B + B1X12 + B2X22+ .............BnnXnn Polynomial form.

y = B + B1x1 + B2x2+ .......BnXn. Linear Regression
Bo = Coefficients, or model paramters.

Types of linear regression - 
1. Simple Linear Regression -  if there is only one input.
2. Multiple Linear Regression -  if there is multiple variance or input

Ordinary Least Square - the squares of the E(epsilon) will be minimized.

Assumptions in Linear Regression.
 1. Correlation this defines that how much linearity is there between any pair of varaiability, Range (1 to -1)
			1 - highly correlated, 0 - means there is no any correlation. 
 a) All Independnt Variable should have 0 correlation among themselves.
 b) Every Independnt variable should be highly correlated.
 
 2. 'E'(Epsilon) follow normal distribution and  constant variance. (Homoskedasticity)
 3. 'E'(Epsilon) should follow IID(Independnt and Identically distributed)
 
 Performance Metrics. (Aplicable to all)
 
 1. MAD/E (Mean Absolute Deviation/Error)
	
 2. Mean Square Error. - shows outliers
 
 3. RMSE ( Root mean square error) - standard deviation which tells the dpread of the error
 
 4. Rsquare(2)
